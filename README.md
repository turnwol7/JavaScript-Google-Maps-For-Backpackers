# Dart - a travel tool for backpackers

![demogif](gif.gif)

This web app requires your own Google Maps API key.

The purpose of this project was to get familiar manipulating CSV files with Javascript.

Insert your API key in the index.html file where I have put square brackets.

Have fun picking the best place to travel with the lowest crime rates!
